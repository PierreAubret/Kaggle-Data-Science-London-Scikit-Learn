Hey Guys, I found this competition months after the competition ended but still gave a try. I found out that using Random Forest Classifier works great with this model, but to better train the model, it is wise to use some clustering algorithm like Gaussian Mixture. I have uploaded my code. Please have a look and I am sure that you can learn a lot from it.
